# Omnomnom
A telegram chatbot which recommends food places based on input strings.

# Data
The data is sourced through web scraping the Burpple website. Burpple is a site where people share food reviews. However, there are only textual reviews. So, sentiment analysis is done to assign the polarity scores for each review, which is then aggregated to form the ratings for each food place.

# Video Walkthrough
